# PCA-analysis-of-Clustering
Here in this program differences occured in K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering were observed because of PCA.
Whole point of this project was to observe effect of PCA on performance and accuracy of Clustering algortihms like K-Means algorithms and Agglomerative CLustering algorithm of hierarchical clustering type. Here K-Means and Hierarchical clustering were performed on a dataset with Patient attributes regarding his/her possibility of having a heart disease, this was done obviously aftert doing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Feature Engineerign on it. Results of these clustering models were recorded as two separate columns and then PCA was done where 3 principal components were extracred and on a separate dataset was created with these three principal components, this dataset was then clustered via K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering and then performance of two models were compared. Similar task was done on a wine quality dataset. There is documentation attached to these to .py files with names of datasets they belong to.
